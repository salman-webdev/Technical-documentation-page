                <p>User Experience Design is an approach to design that takes into account all the aspects of a product or service with the user. 
                    That includes not only the beauty and function: (usability and accessibility) of a product or a flow, 
                    but also things like delight, and emotion—things that are harder to engineer and achieve.
                </p>
                <p>While a designer can create a toggle, a flow, or an interaction that is beautiful, unique, sexy, 
                    and functional in a flow—UXD extends into all the disciplines that come together to make the user experience as a whole great.

            <article>
                    <p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, 
                            in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. 
                            While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design.
                            it no longer makes sense to regard HCI as a specialty of computer science; HCI has grown to be broader, larger and much more diverse than computer science itself. 
                            HCI expanded from its initial focus on individual and generic user behavior to include;
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Social and Organizational Computing</li>
                                <li>Accessibility for the elderly</li>
                                <li>Cognitively and Physically Impaired, and for all people.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For the widest possible spectrum of human experiences and activities. It expanded from desktop office applications to include; </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Games</li>
                              <li>Learning and Education</li>
                              <li>Commerce</li>
                              <li>Health and Medical applications</li>
                              <li>Emergency planning and response</li>
                              <li>and systems to support collaboration and community</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It expanded from early graphical user interfaces to include myriad interaction techniques and devices, multi-modal interactions, 
                                tool support for model-based user interface specification, and a host of emerging ubiquitous, handheld and context-aware interactions.
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>The UX Value of HCI and Its Related Realms</h3>
                            <p>HCI is a broad field which overlaps with areas such as user-centered design (UCD), user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) design. In many ways, HCI was the forerunner to UX design.
                                Despite that, some differences remain between HCI and UX design. Practitioners of HCI tend to be more academically focused. 
                                They're involved in scientific research and developing empirical understandings of users. 
                                Conversely, UX designers are almost invariably industry-focused and involved in building products or services, such as; smartphone apps and websites. 
                                Regardless of this divide, the practical considerations for products that UX professionals concern themselves with have direct links to the findings of HCI specialists about users’ mindsets. 
                                With the broader span of topics that HCI covers, UX designers have a wealth of resources to draw from, although much research remains suited to academic audiences. 
                                Those who are designers also lack the luxury of time which HCI specialists typically enjoy. So, we must stretch beyond our industry-dictated constraints to access these more academic findings. 
                                When you do that well, you can leverage key insights into achieving the best designs for your users. By “collaborating” in this way with the HCI world, designers can drive impactful changes in the market and society.

            </header>
            <article>
                    <p>UX is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. 
                            This includes a website, web application, 
                            desktop software and basically any form of human/device interaction.</p>
                        <p>
                            User experience (UX) focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations.  
                            It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project. 
                            UX best practices promote improving the quality of the user’s interaction with 
                            and perceptions of your product and any related services.
                            At the core of UX is ensuring that users find value in what you are providing to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order for there to be a meaningful and valuable user experience, information must be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Useful:</strong> Your content should be original and fulfill a need.</li>
                            <li><strong>Usable:</strong> Site must be easy to use.</li>
                            <li><strong>Desirable:</strong> Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation</li>
                            <li><strong>Findable:</strong> Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities</li>
                            <li><strong>Credible:</strong> Users must trust and believe what you tell them</li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote><p>“When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, 
                            then the (designer) has failed. 
                            On the other hand, if people are made safer, 
                            more comfortable, more eager to purchase, 
                            more efficient—or just plain happier—by contact with the product, 
                            then the designer has succeeded.”</p></blockquote>

                <h1>Why is UX important</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                        UX is important because it tries to fulfill the user’s needs. UX design bridges the gap between the users’ needs and the goals of a product or service. 
                        It helps in creating a design that the users find useful, usable, and attractive at the same time, resulting in a wider customer base and increased revenue. 
                        It aims to provide positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. With good UX design practices, it makes the tasks of developers easy as well. 
                        In case of an issue, for instance, it is easier to identify the problem, get feedback from the users, and resolve the issue in a little time. 
                        This not only saves cost but also brings relief to the developers and helps make seemless experience for users.
                        Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success.
