                <p>User Experience Design is an approach to design that takes into account all the aspects of a product or service with the user. 
                    That includes not only the beauty and function: (usability and accessibility) of a product or a flow, 
                    but also things like delight, and emotion—things that are harder to engineer and achieve.
                </p>
                <p>While a designer can create a toggle, a flow, or an interaction that is beautiful, unique, sexy, 
                    and functional in a flow—UXD extends into all the disciplines that come together to make the user experience as a whole great.

                    <p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, 
                            in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. 
                            While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design.
                            it no longer makes sense to regard HCI as a specialty of computer science; HCI has grown to be broader, larger and much more diverse than computer science itself. 
                            HCI expanded from its initial focus on individual and generic user behavior to include;
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Social and Organizational Computing</li>
                                <li>Accessibility for the elderly</li>
                                <li>Cognitively and Physically Impaired, and for all people.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For the widest possible spectrum of human experiences and activities. It expanded from desktop office applications to include; </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Games</li>
                              <li>Learning and Education</li>
                              <li>Commerce</li>
                              <li>Health and Medical applications</li>
                              <li>Emergency planning and response</li>
                              <li>and systems to support collaboration and community</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It expanded from early graphical user interfaces to include myriad interaction techniques and devices, multi-modal interactions, 
                                tool support for model-based user interface specification, and a host of emerging ubiquitous, handheld and context-aware interactions.
                            </p>
            
                            <h2>The UX Value of HCI and Its Related Realms</h2>
                            <p>HCI is a broad field which overlaps with areas such as user-centered design (UCD), user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) design. In many ways, HCI was the forerunner to UX design.
                                Despite that, some differences remain between HCI and UX design. Practitioners of HCI tend to be more academically focused. 
                                They're involved in scientific research and developing empirical understandings of users. 
                                Conversely, UX designers are almost invariably industry-focused and involved in building products or services, such as; smartphone apps and websites. 
                                Regardless of this divide, the practical considerations for products that UX professionals concern themselves with have direct links to the findings of HCI specialists about users’ mindsets. 
                                With the broader span of topics that HCI covers, UX designers have a wealth of resources to draw from, although much research remains suited to academic audiences. 
                                Those who are designers also lack the luxury of time which HCI specialists typically enjoy. So, we must stretch beyond our industry-dictated constraints to access these more academic findings. 
                                When you do that well, you can leverage key insights into achieving the best designs for your users. By “collaborating” in this way with the HCI world, designers can drive impactful changes in the market and society.

            <article>
                    <p>UX is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. 
                            This includes a website, web application, 
                            desktop software and basically any form of human/device interaction.</p>
                        <p>
                            User experience (UX) focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations.  
                            It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project. 
                            UX best practices promote improving the quality of the user’s interaction with 
                            and perceptions of your product and any related services.
                            At the core of UX is ensuring that users find value in what you are providing to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order for there to be a meaningful and valuable user experience, information must be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Useful:</strong> Your content should be original and fulfill a need.</li>
                            <li><strong>Usable:</strong> Site must be easy to use.</li>
                            <li><strong>Desirable:</strong> Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation</li>
                            <li><strong>Findable:</strong> Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities</li>
                            <li><strong>Credible:</strong> Users must trust and believe what you tell them</li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote><p>“When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction,

                            more comfortable, more eager to purchase, 
                            more efficient—or just plain happier—by contact with the product, 
                            then the designer has succeeded.”</p></blockquote>

            <article>
                <p>
                        UX is important because it tries to fulfill the user’s needs. UX design bridges the gap between the users’ needs and the goals of a product or service. 
                        It helps in creating a design that the users find useful, usable, and attractive at the same time, resulting in a wider customer base and increased revenue. 
                        It aims to provide positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. With good UX design practices, it makes the tasks of developers easy as well. 
                        In case of an issue, for instance, it is easier to identify the problem, get feedback from the users, and resolve the issue in a little time. 
                        This not only saves cost but also brings relief to the developers and helps make seemless experience for users.
                        Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success.

                    UX (user experience) research is the study of learning what end users of a system or product need and want, 
                    then employing those insights to enhance the design process for products, services or software. 
                    Doing so, they reveal valuable information which can be fed into the design process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you do UX research, you’ll be able to give users the best solutions—because you can discover exactly what they need. 
                    You can apply UX research at any stage of the design process.
                    UX researchers adopt various methods to uncover problems and design opportunities.
                    There are two main types of UX research methods: <b>Quantitative</b> and <b>Qualitative.</b>
                    UX researchers often begin with qualitative measures, 
                    Later, they might use quantitative measures to test their results. 
                </p>
                <h3>Quantitative</h3>
                <p>
                    With this research method, UX researchers test theories about people's behaviors and attitudes based on numerical and statistical evidence. 
                    The goal is to determine users’ motivations and needs. 
                    Quantitative methods answer such questions as, 
                    "What percentage of people can find the call to action?" or "How many users clicked on a particular link?" 
                    This method is key to understanding statistical possibilities and what is happening in an application or website but what quantitative research doesn’t tell you is <b>"why"</b> particular trends or patterns occur.
                    Examples include; analytics, surveys, and A/B testing.
                </p>
                <h3>Qualitative</h3>
                <p>
                    Qualitative research explores user’s attitudes, behaviors, and opinions. 
                    It provides key insights into understanding the context behind why trends and patterns arise.
                    Qualitative research uncovers the ‘why’. 
                    “Why do users have a particular attitude towards a product?” and 
                    “What else do people see on the page?”
                    Examples include; User interviews, customer calls, usability testing, and field studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can additionally divide UX research into two approaches:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Attitudinal</b> – you listen to what users say—
                            e.g., in interviews.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Behavioral</b>  – you see what users do through observational studies.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s important to use a mixture of both quantitative and qualitative methods to come to a holistic understanding of the user and problems to be solved. 
                    Both methods are useful for answering different research questions and cannot substitute one for the other.
                    When you use a mix of both quantitative and qualitative research as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral approaches, 
                    you can usually get the clearest view of a design problem.

                    Information architecture (IA) is, like a blueprint, a visual representation of the product’s infrastructure, features, and hierarchy. 
                    The level of detail is up to the designer, so IA may also include navigation, application functions and behaviors, content, and flows. 
                    IA should encompass the generalized structure of the product so anyone (theoretically) should be able to read it and understand how the product works. 
                    Information architecture aims at organizing content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find everything they need without big effort.

                    Interaction Design (IxD) is the design of interactive products and services in which a designer’s focus goes beyond the item in development to include the way users will interact with it.
                     Thus, close scrutiny of users’ needs, limitations and contexts, etc. empowers designers to customize output to suit precise demands, while for UX designers, “Interaction Design” is the axis on which our work revolves 
                     (i.e., the design of human interaction with digital products); however, the term also applies to understanding how people interact with non-digital products.

                    <p>
                        “Interaction Design is the creation of a dialogue between a person and a product, system, or service. 
                        This dialogue is both physical and emotional in nature and is manifested in the interplay between form, function, 
                        and technology as experienced over time.”

                    Designers’ work in IxD involves five dimensions: 
                    words (1D), visual representations (2D), 
                    physical objects/space (3D), time (4D), and 
                    behavior (5D). <br>
                    IxD’s five dimensions were first defined by a professor at London’s Royal College of Art, 
                    Gillian Crampton Smith, 
                    and a senior interaction designer, Kevin Silver.

                        Words—especially those used in interactions, 
                        like button labels—should be meaningful and simple to understand. 
                        They should communicate information to users, 
                        but not too much information to overwhelm the user.

                    <li>
                        <b>2D: Visual representations</b> <br>
                        This concerns graphical elements like images, 
                        typography and icons that users interact with. 
                        These usually supplement the words used to communicate information to users.

                    <li>
                        <b>3D: Physical objects or space</b> <br>
                        Through what physical objects do users interact with the product? 
                        A laptop, with a mouse or touchpad? Or a smartphone, 
                        with the user’s fingers? And within what kind of physical space does the user do so? 
                        For instance, is the user standing in a crowded train while using the app on a smartphone, 
                        or sitting on a desk in the office surfing the website? 
                        These all affect the interaction between the user and the product.

                        <b>4D: Time</b> <br>
                        While this dimension sounds a little abstract, 
                        it mostly refers to media that changes with time (animation, videos, sounds). 
                        Motion and sounds play a crucial role in giving visual and audio feedback to users’ interactions. 
                        Also of concern is the amount of time a user spends interacting with the product: 
                        can users track their progress, 
                        or resume their interaction some time later?

                    <li>
                        <b>5D: Behaviour</b> <br>
                        This includes the mechanism of a product: 
                        how do users perform actions on the website? 
                        How do users operate the product? In other words, 
                        it’s how the previous dimensions define the interactions of a product. 
                        It also includes the reactions—for instance emotional responses or feedback—of users and the product.

                    Accessibility is a measurement of a user’s ability to use products/services, 
                    the extent to and ease with which they can meet their goals. 
                    Designing with accessibility in mind enables people with a range of abilities and 
                    disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accessibility is a component of usability. 
                    A site that is highly usable will include best practices of accessibility.
                    To achieve accessibility, 
                    you must first understand the technical and physical limitations of your users, 
                    and then determine how the underlying code of your design can empower them.

                    Usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively,
                     efficiently and satisfactorily.

                        “Usability is about human behavior. 
                        It recognizes that humans are lazy, get emotional, are not interested in putting a lot of effort into, 
                        say, getting a credit card and generally prefer things that are easy to do vs. those that are hard to do.”

                    A design’s usability depends on how well its features accommodate users’ needs and contexts. 
                    Therefore, you are responsible for your design’s usability.

                        What are the errors that users make, 
                        how severe are they, and how can users rebound easily

                    Visual design is about implementing text, colors, 
                    and images in a way that enhances a design or interaction.
                    Visual design aims to improve a design’s/product’s aesthetic appeal and usability 
                </p>
                <p>These are some of the most common and fundamental principles of visual design:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Gestalt</b> <br>
                        Use these principles of how people perceive objects to guide how users interpret your design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Balance</b> <br>
                        Use this to distribute elements evenly.

                    <li>
                        <b>Hierarchy</b> <br>
                        Use placement, font, etc. to show importance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Unity</b> <br>
                        use this to establish harmony between page elements, 
                        so they appear to belong together and users aren’t distracted by chaotic (e.g., misaligned) layouts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contrast</b> <br>
                        Use differences in color, etc. to accentuate elements.
